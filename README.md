# graphcentrality

Statistics Project where we will try to develop several methods in order to measure the centrality of different vertices in graphs.
We will for example use stochastic tools to determine the second order centrality of the vertices of different graphs.
And another aspect of this project is the Mining of Twitter, we will have to use the Twitter API in order to have some information about de trending topics and to create a specific graph linking the one who share the same hashtag.
